# Mediator Pattern

    Acts like a middel man between classes/objects

When you have alots of classes and objects inside, there might be a possibility that all objects are connected
to every object in all classes (tight coupling).

For example, you go to a restaurant to eat food. There are 3 people involved to get food:
A customer,
Waiter and
Chef

The waiter acts as a mediator; Imagine if a resturant doesnt have a waiter
the chef needs to:
get the order from the customer,
prepare the food,
serve it,
receive the payment from the customer

The chef has to do alot

Mediator Pattern allows lose coupling of objects. and makes things easier
