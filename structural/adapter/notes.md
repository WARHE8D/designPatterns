# Adapter Pattern

    Used when 2 classes are not compatible with each other, similar to a US plug not working in EU countries.
    We need an _Adapter_ inbetween to make use of that plug
    A common use case would be adding a new feature to a legacy code but not touching the legacy code base as its risky
    Object Adapter is more common than class Adapter
    Object Adapter uses composition
    Class Adapter uses inheritance
