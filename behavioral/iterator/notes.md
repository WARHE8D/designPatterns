# Iterator Pattern

We have used Collections alot of times.
Iterator is one of its methods
and we also have Iterable:
Implementing this interface allows an object to be the target of the enhanced for statement
(sometimes called the "for-each loop" statement)

This pattern helps us loop over similar objects
we can also create custom iterable operations too
